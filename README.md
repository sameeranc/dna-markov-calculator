# dna-markov-calculator

An interactive educational tool that demonstrates how Markov processes work using DNA sequences. Perfect for teaching students the mathematical foundations of sequence analysis in bioinformatics and computational biology.

## Overview
This tool helps students understand how Markov chains calculate probabilities for biological sequences by:

- Visualizing the step-by-step calculation process
- Allowing real-time modification of parameters
- Demonstrating the Markov property (memoryless characteristic)
- Providing interactive learning with immediate feedback

## How to Use

- Enter a DNA Sequence: Type nucleotides (A, T, C, G) in the input field
- Adjust Parameters (optional):
  - Modify prior probabilities for the first nucleotide
  - Change transition matrix values to model different biological scenarios

- Calculate Step-by-Step:

  - Click "Next Step" to advance manually, or
  - Use "Auto Play" for automatic progression

- Analyze Results: Review the final probability and step-by-step breakdown
